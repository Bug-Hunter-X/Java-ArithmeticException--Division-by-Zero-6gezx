# Java ArithmeticException: Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common yet sometimes elusive Java error: the `ArithmeticException` thrown when dividing by zero.  The example is intentionally simple, but similar issues can arise in more complex situations involving dynamic calculations or user input.

The `UncommonBug.java` file shows the problematic code, and the solution is provided in `UncommonBugSolution.java`.
